Try two, here we go.

This is an attempt to update Not Tetris 2 to 64-bit by updating the source to the new version of LOVE (11.2) from the version it was originally written for (0.7.2)

LOVE: https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page
Not Tetris 2: https://stabyourself.net/nottetris2/

Instead of trial and error with the original source straight onto 11.2, i'm going to do these things:
1. Make the original code good instead of sucky
2. Update the API from 0.7.2 -> 0.8.0 
3. Update the source to match that new API
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until i get 11.2 working

64-bit support begins in LOVE 0.9.0, which is great, but i'd prefer to get it up to date.

A 64-bit rewrite/modification of Not Tetris 2 that i'm working on

Not Tetris 2 can be downloaded here: https://stabyourself.net/nottetris2/

This is being modified to work in LOVE 11.2 rather than 0.7.2 (!)

Todo:

--many many errors in the Stack gamemode

--Normal gamemode only drops 1 piece

--error when exiting normal gamemode

--error when resuming normal gamemode

--rotational and lateral velocity is too low
